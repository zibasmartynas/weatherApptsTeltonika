# Vue Weather App

A simple Weather App built with Vue 3 Composition API and TypeScript. The app fetches current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and allows users to add, remove, and search forecasts. Forecasts are stored in localStorage and automatically updated every 5 minutes.

Designed with Bulma.io and built with Vite.

## Features

Add weather forecasts by City name, ZIP code, or coordinates.

Paginated table showing 10 forecasts per page.

View details: temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, sunrise/sunset, and weather icon.

Search forecasts on the main page.

Remove forecasts from the list.

Automatic updates of forecasts every 5 minutes.

Notifications for success and error messages.

Local storage persistence (saved forecasts appear on page reload).

Sunrise and sunset shown in 24-hour format.

Responsive and minimal design using Bulma.


You can run the app locally to see it in action.
